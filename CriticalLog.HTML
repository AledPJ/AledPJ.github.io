I identified the standards I would I aim to use from the www.W3.org website to ensure I was implementing worldwide standards. I did this throughout my website. The website element names are entirely lower case and all HTML elements are closed as this is considered better practice. I ensured that the website uses HTML Protocol for embedded resources where possible. 
One of the advantages of CSS3 over CSS2 is the new properties for making customising the number and size of the columns within the website easier. Another feature of CSS3 that the website takes advantage of is the file sizes and faster loading times to ensure a smooth user experience.
